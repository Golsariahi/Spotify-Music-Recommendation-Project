# Spotify Music Trends and Personalized Recommendation System  

## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing historical music trends and developing a personalized music recommendation system for Spotify users. By leveraging a dataset of over 170,000 songs and machine learning techniques, the project aims to improve user engagement, enhance the listening experience, and contribute to revenue growth for Spotify.

## Business Problem  
Spotify users often struggle to discover music that aligns with their preferences. This project addresses two key challenges:  
1. **Understanding Music Trends:** How have music features (e.g., loudness, energy, and acousticness) evolved over the past century?  
2. **Personalized Recommendations:** How can Spotify deliver more relevant song recommendations based on track characteristics?

## Dataset  
- **Source:** Spotify Song Dataset  
- **Key Features:**  
  - **Song Data:** Title, artist, album, release date, duration, and audio features (e.g., tempo, loudness, key).  
  - **Genre Data:** Information about genres and sub-genres.  
  - **Artist Data:** Number of songs, average tempo, loudness, and popularity metrics.

## Methodology  

### 1. Data Cleaning  
- Removed duplicates and standardized inconsistent data formats.  
- Addressed missing values to ensure dataset completeness.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Identified key trends in music features over time:  
  - Modern music shows increased **energy** and **loudness** with decreased **acousticness.**  
  - Danceable and positive songs correlate strongly with popularity.  
- Explored correlations between features like valence, danceability, and energy.  

### 3. Machine Learning: K-Means Clustering  
- Grouped songs into clusters based on features like tempo, valence, and loudness.  
- Created distinct clusters to identify patterns in genres and song characteristics.  

### 4. Recommendation System  
- Built a **content-based filtering** recommendation engine using cosine similarity.  
- Focused on the top 50,000 popular songs for optimized performance.  
- Validated recommendations by matching test songs to similar clusters.

## Key Insights  
1. Popular songs today tend to be louder, faster, and less acoustic compared to earlier decades.  
2. Danceable and positive songs are more likely to achieve higher popularity.  
3. Clustering effectively groups songs with similar characteristics, improving personalization.

## Business Recommendations  
1. **Data-Driven Playlists:** Use trends like high energy and danceability to curate popular playlists.  
2. **Improved Discovery:** Enhance Spotifyâ€™s recommendation engine with clustering and cosine similarity for more accurate suggestions.  
3. **Targeted Marketing:** Promote high-energy and danceable tracks to younger audiences through social media campaigns.

## Future Enhancements  
1. Incorporate user listening history to implement collaborative filtering.  
2. Include real-time trends and social media data for better predictions.  
3. Combine content-based and collaborative filtering to improve recommendation accuracy.
